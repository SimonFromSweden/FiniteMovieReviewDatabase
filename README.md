# FiniteMovieReviewDatabase

## What does it do?
This project I created in ASP.NET Core MVC is a movie review website. It allows logged in users to like, dislike or comment on a select number of movies (thereby the name Finite Movie Review Database). It is a prototype for a website that would able to create a movie community around liking certain movies.

## How does it work?
It allows the users to either upvote or downvote the movies, and the main movie-grid will sort so that the movies with the most likes, and least dislikes, bubbles up to the top. It also allows users to comment on the movies. When you click a movie it will let you view a short description of the movie, the trailer, a link to the corresponding IMDB-site and display all of the comments that have been made about the movie by the users.

## Who made it?
I made it as a way to keep developing my skills in ASP.NET Core MVC. Specifically I wanted to learn more about database relationsships. I visualized a website where you could like or dislike each movie, and make comments. I am happy with the results!
